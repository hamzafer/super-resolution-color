Mostly like some blur effects and that's how I came to my final decision.,"The images look AI generated. Idk if this is the experiment or the super-resolution of the real images. I believe sometimes I was biased by looking at the images as there were other things which made my decision a bit hard. Like in the AI generated images the people faces are not perfect, they seem blurred in all the images. Which is what I was looking for in certain cases, In real images this won't be the case (Typically the low resolution image would have atrifacts and the high resolution image would have more details). 

But Idk if super-resolution of AI generated was your experiment or not."

Relevance to Context:
Images are selected or designed to match your project's specific use case or narrative. For example, if you're working on an IoT-based smart home system, I'd focus on images that visually represent connectivity, devices, or user interfaces.

Appropriate Color Palette:
Colors play a significant role in evoking the right mood and ensuring clarity. For a modern tech interface, neutral tones with pops of blue or green might symbolize innovation and trust. For a vibrant e-commerce platform, warm or dynamic colors may be chosen.

Details and Usability:
Detailed visuals that are free of distracting elements make communication clearer. For example, clean diagrams or UI representations are often better than overly stylized ones.

Clarity and Lack of Artifacts:
High-quality images with smooth lines and no pixelation or compression artifacts are crucial, especially for professional projects. This ensures your output looks polished and credible.

Alignment with Brand or Style:
If your project has a specific brand or style direction (modern, minimal, playful, etc.), the images are chosen to reflect that tone.",Everything is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!

Sharpness, smoothness and color (saturation / highlights / shadows). I went for the balance between these 3 metrics. Some images were sharpened but they felt a bit saturated and over sharpened. I went with images which had a good balance between sharpness and smoothness and also weren't too saturated or bright when compared to the original image. Hope this helps.  ",No feedback provided
